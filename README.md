🚀 Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)

Welcome to my DSA Practice Repository!
This repo is where I solve, practice, and document Data Structures and Algorithms problems in C++ (and sometimes other languages). It’s meant to track my learning journey, improve problem-solving skills, and serve as a quick reference for future me (and maybe you too 😉).

📂 Repository Structure

Each folder contains problems and solutions related to that topic. File names are usually descriptive so you can easily guess the problem type.

🛠️ Languages & Tools

C++ (primary)

Standard Template Library (STL)

Occasionally: Python, Java (for experimenting)
